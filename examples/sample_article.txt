Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-Infected Patients

Abstract:
Background: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV treatment. This randomized trial
evaluated the efficacy of early versus delayed ART initiation.

Methods: We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled trial from 2020 to 2023. Participants
were HIV-positive adults with CD4 counts between 350-500 cells/μL. The study was registered
with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT12345678).

Results: Of 500 participants randomized, 248 received immediate ART and 252 received delayed
ART. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. The primary outcome showed
significant benefit for early ART initiation (p<0.001).

Conclusions: Early ART initiation provides significant clinical benefits over delayed treatment.

Introduction:

Scientific Background:
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection remains a global health challenge. While
antiretroviral therapy has dramatically improved outcomes, the optimal timing of treatment
initiation remains debated. Previous observational studies suggested benefits of early treatment,
but randomized trial data were limited.

Objectives:
The primary objective of this trial was to determine whether immediate ART initiation is
superior to delayed initiation in reducing disease progression. Our hypothesis was that
early treatment would reduce viral load and improve CD4 count recovery.

Methods:

Trial Design:
This was a parallel-group randomized controlled trial with 1:1 allocation ratio. The trial
design remained unchanged throughout the study period. Randomization was performed using
computer-generated random sequences with stratification by baseline CD4 count.

Participants:
Eligibility criteria included: (1) HIV-1 infection confirmed by Western blot, (2) age 18-65
years, (3) CD4 count 350-500 cells/μL, (4) no prior ART exposure. Exclusion criteria were
pregnancy, active opportunistic infections, or contraindications to study medications.

The study was conducted at 15 clinical sites across the United States, including academic
medical centers and community clinics. Recruitment occurred from January 2020 to December 2021.

Interventions:
The immediate ART group received tenofovir/emtricitabine plus efavirenz (300/200/600mg) once
daily starting at enrollment. The delayed ART group received the same regimen starting when
CD4 count decreased below 350 cells/μL or clinical symptoms developed. All participants
received standard adherence counseling and monthly follow-up visits.

Outcomes:
The primary outcome was time to AIDS-defining illness or death, assessed through 24 months
of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included CD4 count change, viral load suppression, and
quality of life measures. All outcomes were pre-specified in the protocol before enrollment.

Sample Size:
Sample size was determined using power calculations assuming 30% reduction in primary outcome.
With 80% power and alpha=0.05, we required 250 participants per group. No interim analyses
were planned.

Randomization and Allocation Concealment:
Random allocation sequences were generated using permuted blocks of varying sizes (4 and 6)
by an independent statistician. Allocation was concealed using sequentially numbered, sealed,
opaque envelopes stored at a central coordinating center.

Implementation:
The coordinating center generated the randomization sequence. Study coordinators at each
site enrolled participants after obtaining informed consent. Treatment assignments were
revealed by opening the next envelope in sequence.

Blinding:
Due to the nature of the intervention, participants and clinicians could not be blinded to
treatment assignment. However, laboratory personnel and outcome assessors were blinded to
group allocation.

Statistical Methods:
Primary analyses compared groups using intention-to-treat principles. Time-to-event outcomes
were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression. Continuous
outcomes were compared using t-tests and linear regression. We performed pre-specified
subgroup analyses by baseline CD4 count, age, and sex.

Results:

Participant Flow:
A total of 1,247 individuals were screened for eligibility. Of these, 747 did not meet
inclusion criteria and were excluded. 500 participants were randomly assigned: 248 to
immediate ART and 252 to delayed ART. All participants received their assigned intervention
and were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.

Recruitment:
Recruitment began on January 15, 2020 and ended on December 30, 2021. Follow-up was
completed on December 30, 2023. The trial ended as planned after all participants completed
24 months of follow-up.

Baseline Data:
Table 1 shows baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. Mean age was 38.4 years
in the immediate group and 37.9 years in the delayed group. Baseline CD4 counts were
426 cells/μL and 431 cells/μL, respectively. Groups were well-balanced for sex, race,
and viral load.

Numbers Analyzed:
All 500 randomized participants were included in the primary intention-to-treat analysis:
248 in the immediate ART group and 252 in the delayed ART group.

Outcomes and Estimation:
During 24 months of follow-up, AIDS-defining events or death occurred in 12 participants
(4.8%) in the immediate ART group compared to 38 participants (15.1%) in the delayed group.
The hazard ratio was 0.31 (95% CI: 0.16-0.59, p<0.001). The absolute risk reduction was
10.3%, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 10.

Secondary outcomes showed that immediate ART resulted in higher CD4 count increases
(mean difference 89 cells/μL, 95% CI: 65-113) and greater viral suppression rates
(91% vs 67%, relative risk 1.36, 95% CI: 1.24-1.49).

Ancillary Analyses:
Pre-specified subgroup analyses showed consistent benefits of immediate ART across all
examined subgroups. Post-hoc analyses of resistance mutations found no significant
differences between groups.

Harms:
Adverse events were reported in 89 participants (35.9%) in the immediate group and
67 participants (26.6%) in the delayed group. Most were mild to moderate in severity.
Serious adverse events occurred in 8 immediate ART participants and 15 delayed ART
participants. No deaths were attributed to study medications.

Discussion:

Key Results:
This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that immediate ART initiation significantly
reduced the risk of AIDS-defining illness or death compared to delayed treatment. The
benefit was consistent across subgroups and accompanied by improvements in immunologic
and virologic outcomes.

Limitations:
Several limitations should be noted. First, participants and providers were not blinded
to treatment assignment, which could introduce bias in subjective outcomes. Second, the
study population was relatively young and healthy, which may limit generalizability.
Third, loss to follow-up was minimal but could introduce bias if differential between groups.

Interpretation:
Our findings strongly support current guidelines recommending immediate ART for all
HIV-infected individuals regardless of CD4 count. The benefits outweigh the potential
harms, and early viral suppression likely prevents transmission and preserves immune function.

Generalizability:
These results are likely generalizable to similar populations of HIV-infected adults in
resource-rich settings. External validity to resource-limited settings or specific
subpopulations requires further investigation.
